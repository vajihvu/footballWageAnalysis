# footballWageAnalysis

# Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between football player wages and on-field performance metrics such as goals, assists and matches played.
The goal is to identify patterns and correlations between pay and performance, and to assess wage efficiency across different player positions.
The project focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# Objectives

Clean and preprocess football player datasets for analysis.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights.
Visualize wage-performance relationships across player positions.
Identify patterns of inefficiency (for example high wages but low output).

# Dataset

Scraped data from websites such as transfermarkt for statistics and capology for estimated wages.
Dataset consists of - Player_Name, Position, Age, Matches_Played, Goals, Assists, Weekly_Wages and Annual_Wages.

# Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn
Environment: VS Code

# Analysis Performed

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates and invalid wage entries.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculating averages, distributions and ratios.
Correlation Analysis: Exploring relationships between wages, goals, assists and age.

# Visualizations:

Scatter plots showing wage vs goals and assists.
Heatmaps of feature correlations.

# Key Insights

Positive correlation found between goals scored and weekly wages.
Some players show disproportionately high wages compared to performance output.
Younger players tend to have higher goals-per-match ratios but lower wages.

# Future Enhancements

Add a machine learning model to predict player market value based on goals, assists and performance ratings.
Integrate interactive dashboards using Streamlit.
Fetch real world data from public APIs (FBref or Sofifa) for live analysis.
